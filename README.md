# flstudio_project_organizer
Python program to organize older FL studio project files.
Creates a folder for every .flp file in a given folder, moves the .flp files to their respective folders along with any .mp3/.wav bounces, and then creates an empty "Backup"  folder in each of those folder (Useful to get projects from older FL Studio versions in the same format as projects created in FL Studio 2024).
